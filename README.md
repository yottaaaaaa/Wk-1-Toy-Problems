### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49

- E - less than 40.

#### Solution
The solution can be found in the file `student_grade_generator.js`.

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector

Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

#### Solution
The solution can be found in the file `speed_detector.js`.
